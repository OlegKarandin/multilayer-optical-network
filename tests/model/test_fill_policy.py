"""FillPolicy: the acceptance-probe reference-loading policy.

ACTUAL probes against the channels lit at probe time — order-dependent,
optimistic. FULL (default) probes against a fully-loaded comb so the delivered
mode is chosen to stay feasible as the network fills: order-independent and
margin-stable. FULL is acceptance-time only; the operating recompute is
untouched (see the plan's acceptance-only decision).

# Task 6 investigation: the multilayer_graph module docstring's Stage 7
# assumptions flagged an "assumed OMS-disjoint" precondition for new-lightpath
# runs within one placement -- unproven, and audited as "plausible/theoretical,
# not concretely reproduced". This section builds the mesh fixture the audit
# didn't have time to build (WLIN/WLOUT+EXPRESS lets a later run re-enter a
# physical span an earlier sibling in the SAME placement already used, at a
# different wavelength) and drives it with the REAL GNPy adapter under
# FillPolicy.ACTUAL. Confirmed real: ~0.03 dB optimism on an 800 km/10-span
# shared OMS (place_demands QoT'd each run against the committed spectrum
# snapshot only, missing the uncommitted sibling's channel). Fixed in
# multilayer_graph.place_demands (see its S7-10 comment); this test is the
# regression.
