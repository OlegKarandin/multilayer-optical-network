def test_route_service_and_check_disjointness_agree_on_hybrid_placements(diamond):
    """The cross-implementation property test the audit called for: the
    layered engine's disjoint_pairs (with explicit endpoints) and the flat
    engine's solvers.check_disjointness must agree on the SAME hybrid pair --
    and the scenario must be built so that the FIXED and BROKEN (positional-
    inference) layered verdicts actually differ, or the agreement assertion
    is vacuous (task-5 review finding: the original version of this test
    shared only the ingress ROADM `roadm_A`, which both the fixed and the
    broken code happened to exclude, so `disjoint=True` either way -- the
    assertion passed even with `endpoints` silently ignored).

    Task-6 (48a751d) correctly made level="node" include phys keys as a floor
    (two vertex-disjoint paths are automatically edge-disjoint, so node-level
    must never be weaker than link-level). That fix had a side effect here:
    the ORIGINAL version of this scenario routed `other` back onto the SAME
    OMS `omsM1B` that `hybrid`'s reused lightpath rides, so once phys keys are
    a floor, both the FIXED and BROKEN layered verdicts detect that shared
    span regardless of whether `endpoints` is wired correctly -- masking the
    thing this test exists to catch.

    To restore genuine discrimination, `other` is routed over a test-local
    PARALLEL M1->B OMS (`omsM1B2`, fresh amps + fiber, distinct ids from
    `omsM1B`) instead of the shared one, reached via the extra M2->M1 edge
    (`omsM2M1`). `hybrid` and `other` then share NODE M1 but via physically
    DISTINCT spans -- so the phys-key floor no longer overlaps, and the
    verdict genuinely depends on whether `endpoints` correctly excludes A/B
    (FIXED) vs. wrongly excludes M1 (BROKEN):

    - FIXED (endpoints=("A","B")): hybrid's keys = {node:M1, phys:roadm_M1,
      ...hybrid's own spans}; other's keys = {node:M1, node:M2, phys:roadm_M1,
      ...other's own spans}; shared = {node:M1, phys:roadm_M1} -> NOT
      disjoint.
    - BROKEN (no endpoints, positional inference off the reused-then-new
      concatenation ("omsM1B","omsAM1")): infers M1 as the mandated endpoint
      (first.src == last.dst == M1) and wrongly keeps A/B instead; hybrid's
      keys = {node:A, node:B, ...hybrid's own spans, phys:roadm_A} (no M1/
      roadm_M1 at all); other's keys are unaffected (single ordered
      NewLightpathRun, positional inference happens to work); shared = {} ->
      disjoint.

    These verdicts are opposite, verified empirically against the real code
    (see task-6-report.md fix section for the exact computed key sets) -- so
    this scenario can actually catch `endpoints` being silently dropped. The
    flat engine is then fed the TRUE physical-order OMS sequences (new-then-
    reused for the hybrid leg, matching how a real caller like
    plan.service_oms_sequence would walk the IP path) and must agree with the
    FIXED layered verdict, not the broken one."""
