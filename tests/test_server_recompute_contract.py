    Setup: two node-disjoint OMS routes (the same diamond fixture used by
    S4-6/S8-5's per-path-comb tests) each carry one committed lightpath --
    lp1 on ROUTE1 @ F, lp2 on ROUTE2 @ G. Imagine lp1 is about to be torn

    (a same-frequency reroute/make-before-break transient). A caller
    constructs loading = {lp1@F, lp2@G, "new channel"@F} intending the new
    channel to land on ROUTE2 as an interferer for lp2.

    Because F is still committed (lp1 hasn't been torn down), F is in
    `known`, so the slot is classified "committed, scope to ROUTE1" rather
    than "uncommitted, broadcast everywhere" -- ROUTE2's lp2 never sees it.
