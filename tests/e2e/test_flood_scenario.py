"""Flood disaster scenario, end-to-end against the real GNPy adapter.

Per CLAUDE-disaster.md, flood is "same machinery [as storm], inverted
filter": a set of assets (buried handholes / low-lying spans, here
hand-constructed since german_17 carries no geo metadata) that working and
protection paths were never checked against at design time. `route_service`
already prefers PHYSICALLY-disjoint working/protection pairs (basis="physical"
default, see route_service.py / allocation.py's `_demand_constraints`), so a
real german_17 build gives protected services whose legs are physically
disjoint but not vetted against any *risk group* -- exactly the gap a
flood-zone risk group exposes.

Opt-in real-adapter test: gated behind MOMCP_RUN_GNPY_E2E=1 via the shared
`german17_built` fixture (tests/e2e/conftest.py). Direct-Python-API
convention throughout, except the explicit MCP-tool-layer check at the end
(tests/conftest.py's `call_tool` helper).

    Why a duplicate check and not a full basis="physical" disjointness check:
    an unprotected search carries no pair-disjointness constraint, so without
    ANY check the healing loop could "converge" (clear the risk_group-basis
    findings it audits) while installing a truly degenerate protection leg
    identical to working. A full physical-disjointness requirement was tried
    first and is NOT always achievable here: german_17 itself is 2-connected
    (no articulation points/bridges), but `avoid` plus candidate feasibility
    (k-limit, wavelength availability, mode feasibility) narrows some
    services' options enough that no physically-disjoint candidate exists
    within the search budget -- verified via a real run showing several
    services and rounds exhausting every candidate with nonempty shared
    assets. That check made the loop never converge for a reason downstream
    of `avoid`, not a correctness defect. The convergence gate this loop
    actually serves is basis="risk_group" (see _heal_endpoint_violations);
