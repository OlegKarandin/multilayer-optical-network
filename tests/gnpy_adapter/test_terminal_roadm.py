"""Step B (S4-4 + S8-3): the path's terminal drop ROADM.

S4-4: each OMS owns its *source* ROADM as chain[0]; the final drop ROADM of a
path is nobody's chain[0], so it is never propagated and its drop-side
add_drop_osnr penalty is omitted even forward. compute_qot must walk the
terminal drop ROADM.

S8-3 (failure-side mirror): because the dst ROADM is absent from OMS.elements,
oms_seq_asset_set can't match it, so inject_failure(("roadm_<dst>",)) no-ops.
Crossing detection must include the terminal ROADM.
