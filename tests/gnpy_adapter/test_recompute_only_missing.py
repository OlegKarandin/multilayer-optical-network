"""`only_missing=True` is the scoping optimization that makes gating a
single-op mutation with a validate_plan-equivalent check viable cost-wise:
recompute_qot_under_loading should skip the real GNPy call for any lightpath
that already has a stored QoTState, since the model's own mutators (add/
remove/set_mode's targeted _invalidate_qot_sharing_oms, apply_nf_delta/
apply_loss_delta's full clear) are what's responsible for marking exactly
what went stale. Two correctness properties matter most: (1) it must not skip
work that's actually needed (validated by the disjoint-route-untouched case
below), and (2) it must never suppress the failed-asset sentinel re-derivation
(S8-1), which relies on running unconditionally every call regardless of
staleness.
