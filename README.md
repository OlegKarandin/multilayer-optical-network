An MCP server that exposes multi-layer optical network analysis as a clean set
of callable tools. It wraps [GNPy](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy)
for physical-layer quality-of-transmission (QoT) evaluation and adds the
primitives an agent (or a human operator) needs to ask **what-if** questions,
route lightpaths, reason about shared-risk groups, and validate change plans
before committing them.

## What it does

- **What-if analysis** — a physics-free margin-threshold screening sweep and
  a physically-grounded degradation path (`inject_degradation` →
  `recompute_qot_under_loading` → threshold crossings). Margin is always an
  *output*, never a dial.
- **Dynamic risk groups** — runtime-injected asset partitions, tested
  independently from static design-time SRLGs, so routing and disjointness
  queries can be re-audited against a partition that didn't exist when a
  working/protection pair was first certified.
- **IP-over-optical coupling** — IP link capacity is *derived* from the
  underlying lightpath's transceiver mode, never stored; a modulation
  downshift or a margin going negative propagates automatically to reduced
  (or zero) IP capacity.
- **Deterministic solvers** — k-shortest paths, disjoint-path computation,
  RSA, and a heuristic multi-layer allocator, each returning a typed
  `solution` / `partial` / `no_solution` result.
- **Snapshot/branch state engine** — every mutation is simulatable on a
  branch before it touches ground truth; `validate_plan` must pass before
  `commit_plan`, and `reconcile()` reads back actual state after a live
  commit to surface drift from partial control-plane failures.

## Architecture

```
                    MCP client (any agent, or a human via a host app)
                                    |
                          MCP tool surface (this server)
                                    |
        +---------------+-----------+-----------+----------------+
        |               |                       |                |

                                    |
                          Network model (in-memory)
                  IP layer over optical layer; services;
                  static SRLGs + dynamic risk groups
```

## Install

Requires Python >= 3.11.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The `dev` extra pulls in the `server` extra (`mcp[cli]`, `pydantic`) plus
`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, and `ruff`. `pyproject.toml` is the single source of
truth for dependencies — there is no separate `requirements*.txt` to drift
out of sync with it.

## Run

```bash
multilayer-optical-mcp
```

Runs the MCP server over stdio, ready to be pointed at by any MCP-speaking
client or host application. With no flags, it starts from an empty
`NetworkModel`.

Pass `--topology` to seed the model from a topology JSON file at startup:

```bash
multilayer-optical-mcp --topology topo.json
```

That loads the physical layer (ROADMs, fibers, spans, SRLGs) only — no
lightpaths, IP links, or services. For a fully-loaded operating network, build
one offline with `multilayer-optical-mcp-build` and load it alongside the
topology with `--state`:

```bash
multilayer-optical-mcp-build --topology topo.json --out state.json
multilayer-optical-mcp --topology topo.json --state state.json
```

The build is a batch job — minutes on a small topology, tens of minutes on a
large one — so it is a separate console script, not something the server
re-runs on every spawn. `state.json` is a delta (lightpaths with QoT, IP
links, services) keyed to `topo.json` by a content fingerprint; the server
refuses to start if the two do not match. `--state` requires `--topology`.

## Test

```bash
pytest tests/
```

The suite is deterministic and seeded — same inputs, same outputs, every
time. A handful of slow, real-GNPy ground-truth tests are skipped by default;
opt in with:

```bash
OPTICAL_NET_RUN_GNPY_E2E=1 pytest tests/
```
