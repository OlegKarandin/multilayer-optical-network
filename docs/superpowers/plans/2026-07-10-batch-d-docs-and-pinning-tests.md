# Batch D — Documentation & Pinning-Test Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
> (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps
> use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Land Part 3 ("Batch D") of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-fix-roadmap-correctness-then-optimizations.md`: lock in the
remaining `docs/inspection-roadmap.md` findings that are documentation-only (no behavior
change) as docstrings/comments at their exact code sites, plus the one real pinning test
(S2-1). Parts 1 and 2 of that master plan (all correctness + optimization batches, C1–C9,
O1–O3) are already landed on `master` — confirmed via `git log`.

**Architecture:** No production logic changes. Each task touches one file (or a tightly
related pair), adding a docstring/comment at the exact site the roadmap finding names, and
is verified by running that file's existing test suite (must stay green — a comment-only
change should never move behavior) plus, where noted, the ground-truth bridge test as a
safety net.

**Tech Stack:** Python, pytest, existing repo conventions (conda env
`multilayer-optical-mcp`).

## Global Constraints

- Every command runs via `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest ...` (project
  convention — see the `project-conda-env` memory).
- One commit per task, commit message format `docs(<scope>): <summary> (<finding ids>)`.
- No physics/behavior changes in this batch. If any edit looks like it would change
  computed output, stop and flag it — it does not belong in Batch D.
- Findings already resolved by earlier landed batches must NOT be re-litigated here; where
  the roadmap's Batch D line said "check first" (S7-9), the check is done below (see Task
  6) and the finding is confirmed still-open as a documentation item.

---

## Pre-flight: confirm baseline is green

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full suite before making any changes**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest -q`
Expected: all tests pass (this is the baseline; Batch D must not regress it).

### Task 1: S2-1 — pin the adjacent-channel `union` invariant

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/gnpy_adapter/test_loading.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Channel`, `LoadingState` from `multilayer_optical_mcp.gnpy_adapter.loading`
  (unchanged; no production code touched).

No code fix needed — the roadmap confirms `LoadingState.union`'s strict-`<` overlap
predicate already allows touching (non-overlapping) channels. This task only adds the
regression test that pins the invariant explicitly, per the roadmap's own ACTION text: *"a
future change relaxing `<` to `<=` would silently break 50 GHz-spaced grids."*

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the pinning test**

Current end of file (`tests/gnpy_adapter/test_loading.py`):

```python
def test_union_rejects_spectrum_clash():
    a = LoadingState(channels=(Channel(193.4e12, 100e9, None, "400G@7.1dB"),))
    b = LoadingState(channels=(Channel(193.4e12, 100e9, None, "300G@4.8dB"),))
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="spectrum clash"):
        a.union(b)
```

Append:

```python


def test_union_allows_adjacent_channels():
    """S2-1: touching-but-not-overlapping channels (a.high_hz == b.low_hz) must
    union cleanly. The overlap predicate is strict '<' on both sides on purpose —
    relaxing it to '<=' would reject legitimate adjacent channels on a 50 GHz grid.
    Pinned here so that relaxation regresses loudly instead of silently."""
    a = LoadingState(channels=(Channel(193.40e12, 100e9, None, "400G@7.1dB"),))
    b = LoadingState(channels=(Channel(193.50e12, 100e9, None, "300G@4.8dB"),))
    assert a.channels[0].high_hz == b.channels[0].low_hz  # exactly touching
    merged = a.union(b)
    assert len(merged.channels) == 2
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest tests/gnpy_adapter/test_loading.py -v`
Expected: 5 passed (the 4 existing + the new one), no code change required for it to pass.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/gnpy_adapter/test_loading.py
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
test(loading): pin strict-< adjacency in LoadingState.union (S2-1)

No behavior change — LoadingState.union already allows touching (a.high_hz ==
b.low_hz) channels. Pins the invariant so a future <= relaxation regresses
loudly instead of silently breaking 50 GHz-spaced grids.

### Task 2: S1-8 + S5-6 — `network.py` docstrings

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/network.py`

**Interfaces:** none (docstrings only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Document `set_service_working_path` as a statement of intent (S1-8)**

Find:

        and make-before-break planning must be able to pin a path before its
        lightpaths are provisioned, or while a link is degraded mid-migration.

        S5-6: QoT is stored as a single QoTState per lightpath (the worse of

### Task 3: S5-2, S5-7, S5-9 — `ip_routing.py` module + docstrings

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/ip_routing.py`

**Interfaces:** none (docstrings only).

never mutates state, and (S5-4) never raises out of the MCP surface.

Stage 5 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):

  first `recompute_qot_under_loading`, `ip_link_capacity_gbps` raises
  LookupError and callers here treat that as capacity "unknown" (S5-4), never a
  crash.
- `working_path` is the only load-bearing path; `protection_path` is standby and
  contributes zero load.
- The IP layer is undirected: one capacity scalar per link, either-orientation
  traversal in `is_contiguous_path` (S5-6 — per-direction optical asymmetry
  never reaches this layer; see NetworkModel.ip_link_capacity_gbps).

### Task 4: S6-5, S6-7, S6-8, S6-9 — `solvers.py` module + docstrings

Stage 6 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):

  direction; a bidirectional span is two independent directed OMS/edges, so
  compute_paths(A,B) can never return the B->A OMS and compute_disjoint_paths
  can never return the two directions of one span as a "disjoint" pair.
- Avoidance is layer-agnostic per-OMS-edge pruning, applied twice
  (build_oms_graph and re-threaded through _oms_between) — the design's key
  correctness property; it holds because both filter on the same `forbidden`
  set (see S6-9 below).
- `avoid.assets` intersects the OMS asset set (oms id + fiber/amp/roadm
  elements) PLUS both endpoint nodes, so naming a ROADM id in avoid.assets
  prunes every OMS through it, not just one fiber at that site.
- Enumeration is deterministic: `_oms_between` sorts by (length, id) when
  weight="length", else by id.
- Disjointness keys are namespaced (`phys:`/`node:`/`srlg:`/`rg:`) so
  basis="union" never collides two different kinds of key.

### Task 5: S7-9, S7-10, S7-12 — `multilayer_graph.py` module + docstrings

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/multilayer_graph.py`

**Interfaces:** none (docstrings/comments only).

**Pre-check already done (do not repeat):** the roadmap's Batch D line flagged S7-9 as
"retired if C7-7 lands first — check". C7-7 (= S2-4, per-format symbol rate) has landed,
but it only added the *plumbing* (`Channel.baud_rate_hz`/`roll_off`) — `allocation._build_loading`
(used by both `allocation.py` and `multilayer_graph.place_demands`) still constructs its
probe `Channel` without populating `baud_rate_hz`/`roll_off` from `ref_mode_id`, so the
probe falls back to `build_si_for_loading`'s scalar default regardless of which mode is
selected. **S7-9 is NOT retired** — document it as originally scoped.

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend the module docstring with the Stage 7 assumptions block**

Find (end of the module docstring):

  run is one lambda end-to-end, never converted mid-path.
- A returned candidate does NOT commit to a specific wavelength; provisioning
  must re-run spectrum assignment before actually lighting a new run.
- New-lightpath runs within ONE placement are assumed OMS-disjoint (S7-10):
  `_build_loading` QoTs each new run against the committed spectrum snapshot
  only, ignoring channels that OTHER new runs in the same placement would
  light. Harmless today because successive runs in one placement are
  separated by grooming hops on different OMS (no shared-fiber NLI between
  them) — an unstated precondition, not a proof.
- `build_layered_graph` and `place_demands` each call `build_spectrum_state`
  independently (S7-12): they agree today because both default to
  `SpectrumGrid.default()`, but passing a custom `grid` to one call and not
  the other would desync the WLE wavelength layers from the NLI loading comb.
  Thread one grid through both if that ever becomes a real caller pattern.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Document the ref-mode QoT probe inheritance (S7-9)**

Find:

```python
    spectrum = build_spectrum_state(model, grid)
    ref_mode = model.modes.list()[0].id
    out: List[Placement] = []
```

Replace with:

```python
    spectrum = build_spectrum_state(model, grid)
    # S7-9: every new-lightpath run in this placement is probed at the SAME
    # ref_mode (the registry's first mode), regardless of which mode
    # _best_feasible_mode later selects for it. Correct only while GSNR is
    # mode-independent given a fixed probe — true here because _build_loading
    # doesn't populate the probe Channel's baud_rate_hz/roll_off from
    # ref_mode_id (they fall back to build_si_for_loading's scalar default,
    # the S2-4 residual), so the probe's spectral shape doesn't vary with
    # ref_mode either. Would need to re-probe at the delivered mode if
    # per-format baud is ever threaded through this probe.
    ref_mode = model.modes.list()[0].id
    out: List[Placement] = []
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Document the OMS-disjoint-runs assumption at its use site (S7-10)**

Find:

```python
            realized: List[NewLightpathRun] = []
            feasible = True
            new_cap = float("inf")
            for oms_seq, lam, run_src, run_dst in new_runs:
                loading = _build_loading(grid, spectrum, oms_seq, lam, ref_mode)
```

Replace with:

```python
            realized: List[NewLightpathRun] = []
            feasible = True
            new_cap = float("inf")
            # S7-10: each new run is QoT'd against the committed `spectrum`
            # snapshot only — a run does not see the channels any OTHER new
            # run in this same placement would light on a shared OMS. See the
            # module docstring's Stage 7 assumptions (OMS-disjoint runs).
            for oms_seq, lam, run_src, run_dst in new_runs:
                loading = _build_loading(grid, spectrum, oms_seq, lam, ref_mode)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the relevant tests**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest tests/model/test_multilayer_graph.py tests/model/test_restoration.py tests/model/test_allocation.py -q`
Expected: all pass, unchanged from baseline.

Module docstring gains the Stage 7 assumptions block (Router.site convention,
structural wavelength continuity, candidate doesn't commit to a wavelength,
independent build_spectrum_state calls in build_layered_graph/place_demands
S7-12). Documents at their use sites: every new run in a placement is probed
at one ref_mode with no per-mode baud plumbed through yet, so S7-9 is
confirmed still-open post-S2-4, not retired; new runs within one placement
assume OMS-disjointness (S7-10). No behavior change.

### Task 6: S7-11 — `restoration.py` cost_facets proxy semantics

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/restoration.py`

**Interfaces:** none (comment only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Document that `cost_facets` are proxies, not physical quantities**

Find:

```python
def _candidate(model: NetworkModel, p: Placement) -> RestorationCandidate:
    lever = _lever(p)
    cost = {
        "transponders": 2.0 * len(p.new_lightpaths),
        "new_lightpaths": float(len(p.new_lightpaths)),
        "hops": float(len(p.reused_lightpaths) + len(p.new_lightpaths)),
    }
```

Replace with:

```python
def _candidate(model: NetworkModel, p: Placement) -> RestorationCandidate:
    lever = _lever(p)
    # S7-11: cost_facets are PROXIES, not the named physical quantity. "hops"
    # is reused-plus-new LIGHTPATH count, not fiber/span hops; "transponders"
    # assumes every new lightpath needs exactly 2 (one per end) and ignores
    # any already-spare transponder inventory. compute_restoration sorts
    # candidates on these proxies (shortfall, transponders, hops) until
    # evaluate_objective's richer cost vector (CLAUDE.md) lands as the ranking
    # function instead.
    cost = {
        "transponders": 2.0 * len(p.new_lightpaths),
        "new_lightpaths": float(len(p.new_lightpaths)),
        "hops": float(len(p.reused_lightpaths) + len(p.new_lightpaths)),
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the relevant tests**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest tests/model/test_restoration.py -q`
Expected: all pass, unchanged from baseline.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/restoration.py
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(restoration): document cost_facets as ranking proxies, not physical units (S7-11)

hops = reused+new lightpath count, not fiber hops; transponders = 2x new
runs, ignoring spare inventory. Candidates are ordered on these proxies until
evaluate_objective replaces them. No behavior change.

### Task 7: S3-2, S3-3 — `synthesize.py` hardcode documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/gnpy_adapter/synthesize.py`

**Interfaces:** none (comments only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Document the flat `add_drop_osnr` hardcode (S3-2)**

Find:

```python
ROADM_TARGET_PCH_OUT_DB = -20.0
ROADM_ADD_DROP_OSNR = 33.0
```

Replace with:

```python
ROADM_TARGET_PCH_OUT_DB = -20.0
# S3-2: every synthesized ROADM gets this add/drop OSNR penalty regardless of
# hardware — there is no per-instance field on the `ROADM` dataclass to source
# a different value from (unlike target_pch_out_db, which IS per-instance;
# see S3-5 and model_to_gnpy_topology). A vendor ROADM with a genuinely
# different add/drop floor is not representable without adding that field to
# `ROADM` and threading it through synthesis the same way S3-5 did for
# target_pch_out_db.
ROADM_ADD_DROP_OSNR = 33.0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Document the flat NF polynomial (S3-3)**

Find:

```python
def _adv_config_path(nf: float, tmpdir: Path) -> str:
    """Write an advanced_model NF config file and return its path string."""
    cfg = {
        "nf_fit_coeff": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, float(nf)],
        # S3-10: the amp NF-fit band is one guard band wider than the SI channel
        # band on each edge (see bands.py). Derived, not a bare literal.
        "f_min": AMP_BAND.f_min_hz,
```

Replace with:

```python
def _adv_config_path(nf: float, tmpdir: Path) -> str:
    """Write an advanced_model NF config file and return its path string."""
    cfg = {
        # S3-3: a flat (degree-0) polynomial — NF is constant across gain, not
        # gain-dependent as on a real EDFA. Required shape for CLAUDE.md's
        # advanced_model requirement (nf_fit_coeff must exist so
        # inject_degradation's NF delta actually takes effect — see the
        # gnpy-nf-injection-advanced-model memory), but a simplification versus
        # a real per-amp gain-dependent NF curve.
        "nf_fit_coeff": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, float(nf)],
        # S3-10: the amp NF-fit band is one guard band wider than the SI channel
        # band on each edge (see bands.py). Derived, not a bare literal.
        "f_min": AMP_BAND.f_min_hz,
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the relevant tests**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest tests/gnpy_adapter/test_synthesize.py tests/gnpy_adapter/test_ground_truth_bridge.py -q`
Expected: all pass, GSNR values unchanged (comment-only edit; this is a safety-net run, not
a re-pin — no literal changed).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/multilayer_optical_mcp/gnpy_adapter/synthesize.py
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(gnpy): document the flat add_drop_osnr and NF-polynomial hardcodes (S3-2, S3-3)

ROADM_ADD_DROP_OSNR has no per-instance source (unlike target_pch_out_db,
fixed in S3-5). nf_fit_coeff is a flat degree-0 polynomial, the shape
advanced_model injection requires but not gain-dependent like a real EDFA.
No behavior change; ground-truth bridge re-run as a safety net, values
unchanged.

### Task 8: S3-add-4, S3-add-5 — `topology_import.py` module + importer assumptions

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/topology_import.py`

**Interfaces:** none (module docstring + comments only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a module docstring with the importer assumptions block**

Find (top of file):

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import math
from typing import Any, Dict, List


def split_link_into_spans(
```

Replace with:

```python
# src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/topology_import.py
"""Model-build half of Phase 6a: NetworkModel <- an abstract node/edge graph.

Call order: model_from_abstract_graph(graph, modes) -> per node adds
roadm_/trx_/router_<id>; per edge _edge_spans (-> split_link_into_spans when
span_lengths_km is absent/inconsistent) then _add_directed_oms TWICE (both
directions), each emitting a booster + per-span (fiber, amp) + an OMS whose
elements start at roadm_<src>. The synthesis half (synthesize.py, adapter.py)
is Stage 3/4 of the inspection roadmap.

Importer assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):
- One ROADM/Transceiver/Router per node; roadm_<id> / trx_<id> / router_<id>
  naming. `Router.site == optical-node id` is the src_router -> optical-node
  convention Stage 7 restoration depends on.
- Every edge is bidirectional -> two independent directed OMS with independent
  amp chains (amp_<src>_<dst>_* vs amp_<dst>_<src>_*). The importer builds
  correct reverse-chain impairments, which the adapter (post-S4-2/A2 fix) now
  actually propagates into BACKWARD QoT.

from __future__ import annotations

import math
from typing import Any, Dict, List


def split_link_into_spans(

- [ ] **Step 2: Document `num_spans` as unread (S3-add-5)**

Find:

```python
def _edge_spans(edge: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[float]:

    against len(span_lengths_km) / the derived span count. A graph whose
    num_spans disagrees with the actual span count imports silently."""
    spans = edge.get("span_lengths_km")
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Document `Fiber.a_end`/`z_end` as decorative (S3-add-4)**

Find:

```python
        n.add_fiber(Fiber(id=fid, a_end=f"roadm_{src}" if i == 0 else f"amp_{src}_{dst}_{i-1}",
                          z_end=aid, length_km=float(span_km), type_variety=fiber_type))
```

Replace with:

```python
        # S3-add-4: a_end/z_end are DECORATIVE. They skip the booster (span
        # 0's true predecessor in `elements`) and synthesis wires connections
        # purely from OMS.elements order (synthesize.py), never from these
        # fields. Auditing physical adjacency from Fiber.a_end/z_end reads a
        # topology one hop off from what actually propagates.
        n.add_fiber(Fiber(id=fid, a_end=f"roadm_{src}" if i == 0 else f"amp_{src}_{dst}_{i-1}",

### Task 9: Stage 8 assumptions — `whatif.py` module docstring

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/multilayer_optical_mcp/model/whatif.py`

**Interfaces:** none (docstring only).

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend the module docstring with the Stage 8 assumptions block**

Find:

```python
"""Branch-scoped what-if + injection.

Margin is an OUTPUT: the sweep screens recorded margin; inject_degradation
perturbs a physical parameter and lets margin move via recompute. None of these
mutate ground truth — callers pass a branch model.

Margin is an OUTPUT: the sweep screens recorded margin; inject_degradation

mutate ground truth — callers pass a branch model.

Stage 8 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):
- Injection mutates the model's physical parameters in place on a BRANCH;
  correctness depends on snapshots._clone copying the mutated
  _amplifiers/_fibers AND _failed_assets, and diff() reporting failed_assets
  — verified present.
- `inject_failure`'s -inf QoT sentinel — not `_failed_assets` alone — is the
  mechanism that reaches `simulate_ip_routing` (see
  ip_routing.simulate_ip_routing's S5-7 docstring for how a bare
  model.mark_failed() without a subsequent recompute would be missed there).
- `margin_threshold_sweep` is a pure read; lightpaths with no recorded QoT are
  omitted, never defaulted. Margin is never an input anywhere in this module.

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest tests/model/test_whatif.py tests/model/test_injection_layer_consistency.py tests/test_server_phase6.py -q`

## Final verification

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full suite**

Run: `conda run -n multilayer-optical-mcp pytest -q`
Expected: same pass count as the pre-flight baseline (no regressions, no new failures) —
Batch D is documentation-only.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update the master plan's Batch D status**

In `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-fix-roadmap-correctness-then-optimizations.md`, add a `STATUS`
note under "PART 3 — DOCUMENTATION & PINNING-TEST BATCH (Batch D)" recording it landed,
following the style of the existing `STATUS (2026-07-10): ...` notes on Batches C7–C9/O1–O3.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the status update**

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-fix-roadmap-correctness-then-optimizations.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
