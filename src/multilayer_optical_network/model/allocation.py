"""solve_rsa + solve_allocation — routing+spectrum and greenfield allocation.

Both follow the route-first / mode-from-SNR contract: route by total fiber
length, evaluate GSNR on that path via the GNPy adapter (through the
`QotEvaluator` seam), and accept iff at least one mode is feasible — the
delivered mode is the highest-bitrate one the GSNR supports, gated on the worse
of the two directions. With a single transponder type, GSNR is mode-independent,
so one QoT call per direction suffices.

Outcomes are typed (`solution`/`partial`/`no_solution`); resource exhaustion is
a typed result, never an exception.

`solve_rsa` stays on the flat OMS graph (spectrum-slot assignment). `solve_allocation`
is rebased onto the LAYERED engine (`build_layered_graph`/`place_demands`) so it can
groom demands onto surviving lightpaths' residual capacity, consuming across demands
by synthesizing a Service per demand on a clone and committing it through the real
`objective.apply_candidate` machinery.
