"""Per-service restoration: enumerate recovery candidates over survivors.

Read-only. Prunes the layered graph by an avoid-set (failed assets / SRLGs / risk
groups — srlgs and risk_groups are distinct namespaces, S6-7 fix), harvests
k-best placements over the groom_or_new frontier plus a
new_only fallback, and returns typed candidates (lever ip_reroute / optical_reroute
/ hybrid) with restored/shortfall capacity. Execution (validate_plan/commit_plan/
provision_lightpath) is Phase 7; this tool only enumerates.

    dynamic RiskGroup ids only.

    Thin wrapper over route_service's single-candidate (unprotected) menu: the
    harvest, dedup, and materializability filtering all live there now. Ranking
    is re-sorted here on (shortfall_gbps, cost_vector["scalar"]) rather than
    route_service's plain scalar order, because restoration must still surface a
    FULLY-restoring candidate ahead of a cheaper-but-partial one.

    Deliberately restores the working leg only (protected=False) -- this is
    phase 1 of a two-phase restoration workflow: get the service back up fast,
    then separately decide whether to re-protect it. `protection_pending` on
    the result flags whether that second phase is needed.
