"""IP routing models and functions.

Coupling chokepoint: capacity is DERIVED from the bound lightpath's QoT-gated
mode (NetworkModel.ip_link_capacity_gbps), never stored — CLAUDE.md's
derived-capacity rule. `simulate_ip_routing` is a pure read: it never reroutes,
never mutates state, and (S5-4) never raises out of the MCP surface.

Stage 5 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):
- Every IP link's lightpath is assumed to have a recorded QoT state; before the
  first `recompute_qot_under_loading`, `ip_link_capacity_gbps` raises
  LookupError and callers here treat that as capacity "unknown" (S5-4), never a
  crash.
- `working_path` is the steady-state load-bearing path; `protection_path` is a
  dedicated 1:1 standby that reserves (but does not carry) its full demand and is
  activated by `simulate_ip_routing` the instant any working link goes down.
- The IP layer is undirected: one capacity scalar per link, either-orientation
  traversal in `is_contiguous_path` (S5-6 — per-direction optical asymmetry
  never reaches this layer; see NetworkModel.ip_link_capacity_gbps).
- `offered_load_per_link` is the working-only NOMINAL load; a pinned path may now
  reference a removed link (Phase 7 `remove_lightpath`/`remove_ip_link`), which
  the failover-aware `simulate_ip_routing` treats as a down link, never a KeyError.
