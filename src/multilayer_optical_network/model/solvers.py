"""Step-4 solvers: routing + disjointness over the optical OMS graph.

Deterministic, pure functions over the NetworkModel. Outcomes are typed
(`SolverStatus`); "no path" / "no disjoint pair" are typed results, never
raised exceptions (CLAUDE.md core design rule).

Routing is over an OMS graph: optical nodes are vertices, each OMS is an edge.
Parallel OMS between the same node pair are distinct routes, so candidate
enumeration walks node-simple-paths and expands the parallel-edge choices per
hop (node-level k-shortest alone would collapse parallel OMS into one route).

Stage 6 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):
- The OMS routing graph is DIRECTED (S6-4): one edge per OMS in its travel
  direction; a bidirectional span is two independent directed OMS/edges, so
  compute_paths(A,B) can never return the B->A OMS and compute_disjoint_paths
  can never return the two directions of one span as a "disjoint" pair.
- Avoidance is layer-agnostic per-OMS-edge pruning, applied twice
  (build_oms_graph and re-threaded through _oms_between) — the design's key
  correctness property; it holds because both filter on the same `forbidden`
  set (see S6-9 below).
- `avoid.assets` intersects the OMS asset set (oms id + fiber/amp/roadm
  elements) PLUS both endpoint nodes, so naming a ROADM id in avoid.assets
  prunes every OMS through it, not just one fiber at that site.
- Enumeration is deterministic: `_oms_between` sorts by (length, id) when
  weight="length", else by id.
- Disjointness keys are namespaced (`phys:`/`node:`/`srlg:`/`rg:`) so
  basis="union" never collides two different kinds of key.

    fully-disjoint pair as SOLUTION; with best_effort=True returns the
    minimum-overlap pair as PARTIAL when no fully-disjoint pair exists; with
    best_effort=False and none disjoint, NO_SOLUTION. `weight` ∈ {"hops",
    "length"} orders candidate routes. Assets in `model.failed_assets()` are
    automatically excluded from the search graph, on top of any explicit
    `constraints["avoid"]` (see `_avoid_sets`).

    S6-8: "minimum-overlap" (best_effort) minimizes the COUNT of shared
    namespaced keys (`len(shared)`), not physical severity — one shared SRLG
    (1 key) ranks better than two shared amps (2 keys) regardless of how many
    correlated physical assets the SRLG actually covers. Documented rather than
    weighted by asset count: the cap-32 candidate window (_DISJOINT_CANDIDATE_CAP)
    already makes an exact severity ranking unreliable, so a naive weighting
    would be false precision.

    Caveat: NO_SOLUTION does not always mean "proven infeasible." When the
    candidate space exceeds `_DISJOINT_EMISSION_CAP`/`_DISJOINT_CANDIDATE_CAP`,
    the search is truncated before it can exhaustively rule out a disjoint
    pair, and a truncated search returns the same NO_SOLUTION as a proven one.
    On a very large or highly-parallel topology, a NO_SOLUTION result should
    not be read as full-confidence proof that no disjoint pair exists. The
    result's `exhaustive` field detects truncation via EITHER cap: it is False
    when total candidate emissions hit `_DISJOINT_EMISSION_CAP`, and also False
    when `_DISJOINT_CANDIDATE_CAP` (the distinct-node-path cap) cut the search
    off with at least one more, never-considered node path beyond it (see
    `_enumerate_oms_paths`'s `truncation` param). `exhaustive=True` means
    neither cap bound the search."""
