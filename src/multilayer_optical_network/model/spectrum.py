"""Spectrum state: fixed WDM grid + per-OMS slot bitmasks.

Spectrum occupancy is STORED, efficiently: one integer bit-vector per OMS, bit
`i` set iff slot `i` is lit on that OMS. Feasibility along a path is a bitwise
OR of the path's OMS masks; first-fit is the lowest zero bit; reserve sets the
bit on each OMS in the path. This is the fast-RSA representation — not a
violation of the IP-capacity 'derived, never stored' rule (which is about
capacity = f(mode), a different quantity).

The occupancy index is built from the model's lightpaths (each lightpath's
`center_freq_hz` maps to a slot via the grid). Solvers seed a run-local working
copy so in-progress reservations don't clash with each other.
