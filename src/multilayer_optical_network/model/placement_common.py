"""Shared helpers used by route_service, restoration, and allocation: the
avoid-set -> forbidden-assets translation, the lever classifier for a
Placement, and the three-way SOLUTION/PARTIAL/NO_SOLUTION status rule.

Kept in a neutral module that imports none of route_service/restoration/
allocation, so those three don't have to import each other for shared logic.
Previously `_forbidden_assets`/`_lever` lived in restoration.py despite
restoration.py never calling either itself -- they existed there only for
route_service.py to import, which forced restoration.py to reach back into
route_service.py through a deferred, function-local import to dodge the
resulting cycle (docs/2026-07-19-open-todos.md #4, "layering inversion").
