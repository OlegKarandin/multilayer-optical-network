"""Branch-scoped what-if + injection.

Margin is an OUTPUT: the sweep screens recorded margin; inject_degradation
perturbs a physical parameter and lets margin move via recompute. None of these
mutate ground truth — callers pass a branch model.

Stage 8 assumptions (recorded explicitly, from the inspection roadmap):
- Injection mutates the model's physical parameters in place on a BRANCH;
  correctness depends on snapshots._clone copying the mutated
  _amplifiers/_fibers AND _failed_assets, and diff() reporting failed_assets
  — verified present.
- `inject_failure`'s -inf QoT sentinel — not `_failed_assets` alone — is the
  mechanism that reaches `simulate_ip_routing` (see
  ip_routing.simulate_ip_routing's S5-7 docstring for how a bare
  model.mark_failed() without a subsequent recompute would be missed there).
- `margin_threshold_sweep` is a pure read; lightpaths with no recorded QoT are
  omitted, never defaulted. Margin is never an input anywhere in this module.

    changed, not the cumulative gsnr_db_after figure (which shifts at every
    element downstream of the real cause too, echoing it rather than isolating
    it). Read-only: computes QoT fresh on each model, mutates neither. Both
    result_ids remain retrievable afterward via get_qot_breakdown (same
    `store` for both calls).

    Task 14: a naive diff of model_a's and model_b's own per-element
    gsnr_delta_db (each already a marginal, hop-to-hop figure) still leaks —
    every element AFTER the real perturbation receives a different *input* SI
    in model_b's propagation than in model_a's, even when that downstream
    element's own physical parameters are unchanged, so its own marginal delta
    shifts too (confirmed empirically: a +4 dB NF bump on one amp showed the
    correct -1.53 dB there, but also a leaked +0.29 dB / +0.19 dB at untouched
    downstream amps). Per-row isolation fixes this: for each element position,
    `isolate_element_contribution` replays model_a's OWN trace up to that
    position, then substitutes ONLY model_b's version of that one element, and
    the row compares model_a's baseline delta at that position to THIS
    isolated delta — not to model_b's own (leaky) cumulative trace value.

    Known blind spot (pre-existing, not introduced by Task 14 — pre-fix, this
    case misattributed the delta to the wrong element; post-fix nothing is
    misattributed, it is simply silent): a perturbation whose only effect is at
    the very first noise-introducing element in the chain (e.g. a booster amp
    right after the launch transceiver) can show `gsnr_contribution_delta_db`
    as 0.0 on EVERY row, even though `delta_gsnr_db` (the whole-path summary
    above) is nonzero. That element's `gsnr_delta_db` is `-inf` in both
    branches (the adapter's own `prev_gsnr_db` starts at `+inf`), and
    `_safe_delta`'s `-inf == -inf -> 0.0` handling collapses the row. When this
    happens, `ase_contribution_delta_db` / `nli_contribution_delta_db` on the
    same row still correctly pinpoint the perturbed element (both are plain
    finite-value deltas, not gated by the same infinity collapse).

    Sign/decomposition caveat: rows localize which element's OWN parameters
    changed between the two branches — they are not a decomposition of
    `delta_gsnr_db` and do not sum or reconcile to it, and a given row's sign
    can differ from `delta_gsnr_db`'s sign. Confirmed empirically for a pure
    loss injection (+4 dB on one fiber, 10-span model, delta_gsnr_db=-0.366):
    the only nonzero `gsnr_contribution_delta_db` row is the perturbed
    fiber's OWN row (here +0.044), not a downstream one — every other row,
    including the very next amp, reads exactly 0.0 on `gsnr_contribution_delta_db`,
    which is the isolation working as intended. That row's sign can read
    positive because the injected loss lands at that fiber's own input
    (`extra_loss_db` maps to gnpy's `att_in`), so the signal traversing that
    same fiber is weaker and generates less NLI inside it: signal and ASE
    both drop by the full loss delta while NLI drops further, so the local
    ratio improves even though the whole path degrades. The downstream amp's
    row instead shows the CAUSE of that degradation, not a share of it:
    `ase_contribution_delta_db` / `nli_contribution_delta_db` shift by the
    design-time gain re-target (here +4.0 / +4.0, matching the +4 dB loss
    delta) — a real change to that amp's operating point, not a leftover of
    the perturbed element. Its `gsnr_contribution_delta_db` nonetheless stays
    exactly 0.0: a pure gain change scales signal, ASE and NLI by the same
    factor, so the ratio (and therefore GSNR) is invariant to it; no row
    carries `delta_gsnr_db` itself."""
