# src/multilayer_optical_network/state_file.py
"""Read/write the operating-state file: the loaded steady state a build
produces, as a DELTA on top of an authored topology JSON.

Deployment/config-only, same charter as topology_loader.py -- this module adds
no modeling logic. It serializes exactly the four registries a build populates
(lightpaths, their QoT, IP links, services) and re-applies them through the
model's own mutators. The physical layer is deliberately NOT serialized: it is
re-derived every startup by model_from_abstract_graph, so it cannot round-trip
wrong. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-operating-state-file-design.md.

    links, services. Lightpaths are sorted by id so the same model and meta
    always produce byte-identical JSON for that collection; ordered paths
    (`oms_sequence`, `working_path`, `protection_path`) keep their physical
    order regardless.

    IP links and services are emitted in the model's own iteration order
    (insertion order, `list_ip_links`/`list_services` -- see network.py) and
    deliberately NOT id-sorted: `simulate_ip_routing` builds
    `IPRoutingResult.utilizations` by walking `list_ip_links()` in that same
    order, and its equality is order-sensitive. A build interleaves working
    and protection IP links per demand (`ipl-cand-...`, `ipl-prot-...`), so
    an alphabetical sort would group all "cand" links before all "prot" links
    -- same values, different tuple order -- and silently break
    `simulate_ip_routing(reloaded) == simulate_ip_routing(built)` even though
    every field's value round-tripped correctly. This is still deterministic
    for a fixed model instance (repeated dumps of the same, unmutated model
    iterate its dicts in the same order every time), it just does not imply
    id order.

    `meta` is provenance only -- nothing in it is fed back into the model on
    load, with one exception: `design_margin_db` (written here as
    `model.design_margin_db`) IS read back, by `load_model_from_state_file`,
    because every stored `margin_db` is a USABLE margin measured against that
    value (Task A1's semantic); loading the file into a model with a
    different design margin would silently reinterpret those numbers.
    `fingerprint` is written into it as `topology_fingerprint`.
